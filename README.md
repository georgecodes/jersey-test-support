jersey-test-support - classes to help you unit-test Jersey web services
====================================================================

I wrote these classes a few years back to help me test a project I was working on at the time. I blogged about
unit testing Jersey routes, and over the years, get the occasional tweet or email asking for help, or for
permission to use the code somewhere else. I thought I might as well bung it on Github. So I have.
